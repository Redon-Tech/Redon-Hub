This bot can be hosted virtually anywhere Python 3.9+ can run and there is a internet connection. While this does include hosting at home it is still something we do not recommend and there are many VPS providers, discord bot hosting providers, and even free hosting providers that you can use.

Obviously we recommend using our hosting service, but if you are unable to use it or do not want to use it we have provided a list of other hosting providers below.

## Pterodactyl Panel Hosting
If you host a pterodactyl panel you can download our egg for easy installation. You can find the egg [here](https://github.com/Redon-Tech/Redon-Hub/blob/main/pterodactyl-egg.json).

**This is the easiest other then Redon Hosting and Embotic**

## Recommended Hosting Providers
- [Redon Hosting](https://billing.redon.tech/) (Free[^1], Paid Plans Available)
- [Embotic](https://embotic.xyz/) (Free, provides preinstall for Redon Hub)
- [PebbleHost](https://pebblehost.com/bot-hosting) (Cheap, but does not provide preinstall for Redon Hub)

(I will add more as I find them, if you know of any please let me know in our Discord server)

## VPS Providers
All of these require debit/credit cards to use, most do not accept prepaid cards.

- [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) (Free, difficult to get started)
- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/)
- [Vultr](https://vultr.com/)
- [Linode](https://linode.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
- [Onetsolutions](https://onetsolutions.net/) (Cheap, but limited English support)

[^1]:
    Due to limited resources, we are only able to provide free hosting to a limited number of people.  
    Free servers also come with very limited resources and should not be used for large servers.
