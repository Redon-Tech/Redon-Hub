This guide is the next part after [setting up the database](database.md). If you have not setup the database yet please do so before continuing.

## Creating the JSON File
The bot uses a mix of both a `config.json` and a `.env` file for configuration. The `config.json` file is used for configuration that is not sensitive and can be shared publicly. The `.env` file is used for sensitive information such as tokens and database connection strings. To create the `config.json` file we will copy the `example.config.json` file and rename it to `config.json`. We can do this with the following.
<video width="1920" height="1080" controls>
    <source src="/assets/create_pterodactyl_config.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Configuration Explained
Now that we have our `config.json` file we can start configuring it. Below is a list of all the options and what they do.
```json
{
    "Bot": {
        "Prefix": ".",

        ],
        "Activity": {
            "Presence": "watching {users:,} costumers â€¢ Version {version}",
            "Status": "online"
        }
    },
    "Logging": {
        "PurchasesChannel": 1234567890,

        "Port": 5000,

## Finishing the .env file

Now that we have our `config.json` file we can finish our `.env` file. To do this we will add the following to the `.env` file. Replace the values with your own.

```bash
token=this_is_your_bot_token
```

[Next: Starting the Bot](running.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

[^1]: The first guild in this list will also be the guild the bot will use for customer roles and the purchase channel.
