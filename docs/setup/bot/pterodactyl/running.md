This guide is the next part after [configuration](configuration.md). If you have not configured the bot yet please do so before continuing.

## Running the Bot
The easiest part of this entire guide, running the bot. To run the bot we will do the following:

1. Click the "Console" tab.
2. Click "Start" to start the bot.
3. After the bot has started go back to the "Startup" tab.
4. Disable "DB Push".

## Next Steps
Now that you have the bot running you can start using it. If you need help with commands see [commands guide](../../../guide/commands.md) to get a list of commands. If you need help with anything else you can ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Eb384Xw) server.
