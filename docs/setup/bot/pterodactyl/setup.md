Before we get to setting up our database and configuring the bot we must first install the system. This is different depending on each hosting provider but the process will generally be the same. 

1. You need to purchase a Redon Hub server from your hosting provider, every provider does this in a different way.
2. Once you have purchased a Redon Hub server you need to login and familiarize yourself with the panel.
3. Next you will need to setup a database, this is also dependent on your provider, consult their documentation.
