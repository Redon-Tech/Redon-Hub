This guide is the next part after [configuration](/setup/bot/configuration). If you have not configured the bot yet please do so before continuing.

## Running the Bot
The easiest part of this entire guide, running the bot. To run the bot we will use the following command.

=== "Windows"
    ```bash
    python launcher.py
    ```
=== "Linux"
    ```bash
    python3 launcher.py
    ```

!!! warning

    If you are running the bot on a server you should use a process manager such as `screen` or `systemd`.

??? abstract "Hosting at home"

    I will not be providing any support with port forwarding, I recommend you use a hosting service. If you are unable to figure out how to use a hosting service [we provide one](https://billing.redon.tech).

## Next Steps
Now that you have the bot running you can start using it. If you need help with commands see [commands guide](/guides/commands) to get a list of commands. If you need help with anything else you can ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Eb384Xw) server.
