This guide is the next part after [setting up the place](setup.md). If you have not setup a place yet please do so before continuing.

## Finding the Configuration module
The configuration file is located in ServerScriptService under the name `Configuration`. You can find it by searching for it in the explorer.

## Configuration Explained
