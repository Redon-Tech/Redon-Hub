Setting up the Roblox place is much easier than setting up the bot. Before you can start setting up your Roblox place you must make sure that your API can be accessed by the entire internet and not just your local network. If you can not figure out how to you will need to use [a hosting provider](/setup/bot/hosting).

1. [Select a theme](/guide/themes)
2. [Download latest release of theme](https://github.com/Redon-Tech/Redon-Hub/releases/latest)
3. Publish the place to Roblox

[Next: Configuration](/setup/roblox/configuration){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
